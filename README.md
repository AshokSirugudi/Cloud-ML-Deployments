# Cloud-ML-Deployments

This repository focuses on deploying ML models on popular cloud platforms using modern tooling and deployment standards.

**What**: End-to-end ML workflows with full lifecycle — from data to deployment readiness.  
**Why**: Demonstrates proficiency in engineering, modeling, and ML system design.  
**Where**: Focuses on real projects with clean pipelines, reproducibility, and evaluation.  
**Which**: Best for structured classification and regression problems.  
**How**: Clean data → engineer features → train & evaluate models → automate pipelines.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Showcase ability to move models from development to production
- Demonstrate platform-agnostic cloud deployment patterns
- Integrate with MLOps tools, APIs, dashboards
