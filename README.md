# Cloud ML Deployments

<<<<<<< HEAD
A repository focused on deploying machine learning models using modern cloud platforms and tools.
=======
This repository focuses on deploying ML models on popular cloud platforms using modern tooling and deployment standards.

**What**: End-to-end ML workflows with full lifecycle — from data to deployment readiness.  
**Why**: Demonstrates proficiency in engineering, modeling, and ML system design.  
**Where**: Focuses on real projects with clean pipelines, reproducibility, and evaluation.  
**Which**: Best for structured classification and regression problems.  
**How**: Clean data → engineer features → train & evaluate models → automate pipelines.

## 📌 Project Orientation

**What**: Cloud-based deployment of ML solutions.  
**Why**: To showcase productionization skills using AWS, GCP, Azure, and Databricks.  
**Where**: Includes infrastructure setup, versioning, monitoring, and scaling practices.  
**Which**: Use cases extended from Repo 2 or purpose-built cloud-first models.  
**How**: Containerize model (if needed) → deploy via cloud platforms → monitor & scale.
