# Cloud ML Deployments

A repository focused on deploying machine learning models using modern cloud platforms and tools.

---

## 📌 Project Orientation

**What**: Cloud-based deployment of ML solutions.  
**Why**: To showcase productionization skills using AWS, GCP, Azure, and Databricks.  
**Where**: Includes infrastructure setup, versioning, monitoring, and scaling practices.  
**Which**: Use cases extended from Repo 2 or purpose-built cloud-first models.  
**How**: Containerize model (if needed) → deploy via cloud platforms → monitor & scale.
